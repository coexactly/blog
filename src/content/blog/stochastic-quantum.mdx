Jacob Barandes has a formulation of quantum mechanics which I've been reading about. He says we should forget about wavefunctions and Hilbert spaces, and that a neglected corner of ordinary probability theory is fully equivalent to the full quantum picture. Watch his lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5LEfcwBoQY if you want to listen to him explain it (he's a good speaker, I recommend it), or read his paper here. I'll go over the basic ideas, and work through my thoughts on the theory.

I think it's fair to say that at a first pass, quantum mechanics appears to most students as a rather unnatural theory: While the mathematics involved is on its own not difficult, it *is* abstract, the physical interpretation of it is murky, and it is a hard pill to swallow that gadgets like complex Hilbert spaces and their tensor products which seems like artificial human constructions, are necessary to describe nature. In fact, even the very first students of quantum mechanics struggled with this problem, with von Neumann apparently proclaiming "I don't believe in Hilbert spaces anymore". We might ask then whether we can start with some natural set of assumptions that don't include Hilbert spaces or any quantum weirdness and show that they lead to a theory that is nevertheless equivalent to quantum mechanics.
Barandes attempts this, but he is not the first to do so. In fact, this is precisely the mission statement of the so-called Quantum Reconstruction program. This program has produced a handful of related ways to construct quantum mechanics from natural principles. See the introduction of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.6451 for an overview. Very roughly speaking, in these frameworks QM distinguishes itself from a classical deterministic theory in that even maximal knowledge of a system does not allow perfect prediction of all possible measurements; And further distinguishes itself from an ordinary stochastic theory only by the requirement that information is preserved/all processes are continuously reversible in isolated systems. For example: In the paper I just linked, which adopts an information-theoretic viewpoint, both of these two statements are contained in what the authors call the 'purification principle', without which their axioms would be compatible with a classical theory.

### Stochastic Systems
Barandes' theory is different in that it doesn't, in its basic formulation, make recourse to any generalization or modification of probability theory. Quantum systems are described as 'boring' stochastic systems in his framework, albeit of a somewhat unusual sort. Barandes emphasizes the boringness as a feature. 
Here's how: Given a finite set $S$ (the state space), a 'generalized stochastic system' consists simply of a time-dependent matrix $\\Gamma(t)$ of size $|S|\\times|S|$ whose entry $\\Gamma\_\{ij\}(t)$ tells us the probability of finding the system in state $j$ at time $t$ when initialized in state $i$ at time $0$. The entries, being probabilities, are between 0 and 1 and $\Gamma$ is normalized in the way you'd expect: the columns sum to 1 (we say that $\Gamma(t)$ a stochastic matrix) and $\Gamma(0)=\mathbb 1$.
Given a generalized stochastic system (GSS), if we additionally specify an initial probability distribution $\mathbf\{p\}(0)$ on $S$, to be read as 'the system is in state $j$ with probability $p\_\{j\}(0)$', then we get an evolving probability vector $\mathbf\{p\}(t):=\Gamma(t)\mathbf\{p\}(0)$.
Crucially, $\Gamma(t)$ is not required to factorize as $\Gamma\_\{t'\}(t-t')\Gamma(t')$ for smaller times $t'\<t$ and some stochastic matrix $\Gamma\_\{t'\}(t-t')$. This property would be called Markovianity or divisibility or memorylessness: It would mean that we could think of the time-evolution of the state at any time as only depending on the present state and not its history (but see the warning in the next paragraph). We do **not** assume this, but we leave open the possibility that such a factorisation might happen to be true for special times $t'$ and all $t\geq t'$, in which case we call $t'$ a *division event*. Usually $\Gamma(t)$ will have full rank, in which case division events can be identified by the property that $\Gamma(t)\Gamma^\{-1\}(t')$ is a stochastic matrix for all $t\geq t'$.
