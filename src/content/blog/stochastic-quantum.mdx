Jacob Barandes has a formulation of quantum mechanics which I've been reading about. He says we should forget about wavefunctions and Hilbert spaces, and that a neglected corner of ordinary probability theory is fully equivalent to the full quantum picture. Watch his lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5LEfcwBoQY if you want to listen to him explain it (he's a good speaker, I recommend it), or read his paper here. I'll go over the basic ideas, and work through my thoughts on the theory.
